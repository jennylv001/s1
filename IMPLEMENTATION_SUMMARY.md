# Stealth and Channel Logging Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
Add logging to all mutation/assignment points for 'stealth' and 'channel' in BrowserProfile, Agent, and BrowserSession. Add a log at the actual browser launch to confirm the browser channel. Audit all code paths where BrowserProfile is constructed, ensuring the full config is preserved and logged. If running in parallel (multiple agents), ensure no shared, mutable BrowserProfile objects between agents by logging object identity and construction context.

## Solution Overview

### ✅ Complete Implementation
All requirements have been fully implemented with comprehensive logging that is:
- **Explicit and contextual**: Every stealth/channel mutation is logged with full context
- **Minimally invasive**: No changes to existing function signatures or APIs
- **Object identity aware**: Tracks BrowserProfile objects for parallel agent safety
- **Construction context aware**: Shows where objects are created for debugging

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. BrowserProfile Mutation Logging
**File: `browser/profile.py`**

#### Object Creation Tracking
```python
@model_validator(mode='after')
def log_browser_profile_creation(self) -> Self:
    """Log BrowserProfile creation with stealth and channel details for debugging parallel agents."""
```
- Logs every BrowserProfile creation with object identity
- Captures construction context (file:line, function name)
- Tracks initial stealth/channel configuration

#### Object Copying Tracking
```python
def model_copy(self, *, update: dict[str, Any] | None = None, deep: bool = False) -> Self:
    """Override model_copy to log BrowserProfile copying for parallel agent debugging."""
```
- Logs every BrowserProfile copy operation
- Tracks parent→child relationships
- Detects stealth/channel mutations in updates
- Provides copy context for debugging

#### Stealth/Channel Enforcement Logging
```python
@model_validator(mode='after')
def validate_and_setup_stealth_config(self) -> Self:
    """Validate stealth configuration and apply fallbacks if needed."""
```
- Logs channel mutations when stealth=True forces chrome channel
- Provides context for why mutations occur
- Tracks stealth disabled vs enabled states

### 2. BrowserSession Profile Management Logging
**File: `browser/session.py`**

#### Profile Override Application
```python
@model_validator(mode='after')
def apply_session_overrides_to_profile(self) -> Self:
    """Apply any extra **kwargs passed to BrowserSession(...) as session-specific config overrides on top of browser_profile"""
```
- Logs comprehensive profile override tracking
- Detects stealth/channel mutations during session configuration
- Tracks profile identity changes during copying
- Warns about unexpected configuration changes

#### Playwright Setup with Channel Tracking
```python
async def setup_playwright(self) -> None:
    """Set up playwright library client object"""
```
- Logs channel mutations during playwright setup
- Tracks stealth mode enforcement
- Confirms patchright vs playwright selection
- Provides final configuration verification

#### Browser Launch Confirmation
```python
async def _unsafe_setup_new_browser_context(self) -> None:
    """Unsafe browser context setup without retry protection."""
```
- **CONFIRMED BROWSER CHANNEL**: Logs actual channel used at launch
- **CONFIRMED STEALTH MODE**: Verifies stealth configuration
- Logs binary executable, debug port, total args
- Confirms stealth detection evasion flags count
- Logs browser process startup with PID

### 3. Agent Initialization Tracking
**File: `agent/service.py`**

#### Agent Creation Logging
```python
def __init__(self, ...):
    """Agent initialization with comprehensive profile tracking"""
```
- Logs agent initialization with profile identity
- Tracks input browser_profile configuration
- Monitors profile preservation during setup

#### BrowserSession Creation/Sharing Detection
```python
if browser_session:
    # Log existing vs copied BrowserSession usage
else:
    # Log new BrowserSession creation
```
- Detects multiple agents sharing BrowserSessions (warns about issues)
- Logs BrowserSession creation with profile relationships
- Verifies stealth configuration preservation
- Tracks object ownership for parallel safety

## Parallel Agent Safety Features

### Object Identity Tracking
Every log entry includes:
- **Profile ID**: Short identifier (e.g., `BrowserProfile#a1b2`)
- **Object ID**: Memory address identifier (e.g., `obj#c3d4`)
- **Relationship mapping**: Parent→Child during copying

### Construction Context
Uses Python's `inspect.currentframe()` to capture:
- File path and line number
- Function name where object was created
- Full call stack context for debugging

### Shared Object Detection
- Warns when multiple agents share the same BrowserSession
- Logs object ownership status (`_owns_browser_resources`)
- Provides copy relationship mapping for debugging

## Log Output Examples

### BrowserProfile Creation
```
🏗️ BrowserProfile#a1b2 CREATED (obj#c3d4)
🏗️   └─ Creation context: examples/demo.py:15 in main()
🏗️   └─ Initial config: stealth=True, channel=None
🏗️   └─ Stealth level: military-grade
```

### Channel Mutation
```
🔧 BrowserProfile#a1b2 (obj#c3d4) CHANNEL MUTATION: stealth=True enforcing channel change
🔧   └─ Original channel: None → New channel: chrome
🔧   └─ Context: stealth mode requires patchright compatibility
```

### Browser Launch Confirmation
```
🚀 BrowserSession#xyz1 LAUNCHING BROWSER
🚀   └─ CONFIRMED BROWSER CHANNEL: chrome
🚀   └─ CONFIRMED STEALTH MODE: True (level: military-grade)
🚀 BrowserSession#xyz1 BROWSER PROCESS STARTED
🚀   └─ Process PID: 12345
🚀   └─ Stealth mode: True
🚀   └─ Channel: chrome
```

### Parallel Agent Warning
```
⚠️ Attempting to use multiple Agents with the same BrowserSession! This is not supported yet and will likely lead to strange behavior, use separate BrowserSessions for each Agent.
🤖   └─ Original BrowserSession: xyz1 (obj#i9j0)
🤖   └─ Original config: stealth=True, channel=chrome
🤖   └─ Copied BrowserSession: abc2 (obj#k1l2)
```
